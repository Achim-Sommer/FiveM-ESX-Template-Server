## Requirements

- [esx_addonaccount](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_addonaccount)
- [esx_skin](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core/tree/main/%5Bcore%5D/esx_skin)

### Features

- Jobs: slaughterer, miner, fisherman, journalist, fueler, tailor
- Security deposit when renting a job vehicle (given back in case of crash, to the amount of damage the vehicle has already taken)
- Easy system to create jobs (samples in jobs folder)
- Item farming jobs
This addon is an easy way to have farming jobs on your server, there is no player management.

## iZone integreation (optional)

- You can use iZone with esx_jobs by creating polynomial zones with iZone. When you finish the zone creation, take the zone name and set a Zone field on the job like so:

```
CloakRoom = {
    Zone = "miner_room", -- HERE
    Size = {x = 3.0, y = 3.0, z = 1.0},
    Color = {r = 50, g = 200, b = 50},
    Marker = 1,
    Blip = true,
    Name = TranslateCap("m_miner_locker"),
    Type = "cloakroom",
    Hint = TranslateCap("cloak_change"),
    GPS = {x = 884.86, y = -2176.51, z = 29.51}
}
```

- Note that this is just to have custom zone and avoid using radius.
