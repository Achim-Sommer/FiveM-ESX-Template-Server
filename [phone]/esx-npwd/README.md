If you are using the Overextended fork of ESX then this resource is _not required_.


Setup event handlers and export calls to create the player instance within NPWD after an xPlayer has loaded, ensuring correct no-fuss loading and minimal effort.

- Tested with ESX Legacy
- Should work with ESX v1 Final and v1.2
