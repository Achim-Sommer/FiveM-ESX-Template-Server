# dx_hud

dx_hud is a FiveM HUD for ox_core or ESX Legacy.

## Dependencies

- ox_lib

This also requires a framework of your choice between ox_core and es_extended.  
Note that if you are using ESX, you will also need esx_status and esx_basicneeds.

## Download & Installation

- Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/0xDEMXN/dx_hud/releases "Releases page") and download the latest release
- Place it inside the `resources` directory
- Add the resource to your `server.cfg` after dependencies to make sure it's started correctly at server startup:

```
ensure dx_hud
```

## Configuration

You can add these settings directly to your 'server.cfg', or add them to a separate file (i.e. hud.cfg) and call it with exec. **Convars must be set before starting dx_hud.**

The values below are defaults and should not be explicitly set unless changing the value.
